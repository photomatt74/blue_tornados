The track was through sparsely populated farm country, so damage figures were relatively low for such a long track tornado.  At each of five farmsteads in the direct path of the tornado, farm buildings were destroyed.  Destroyed farm buildings included hen houses, hog sheds, several barns, and storage sheds.  The worst damage, apparently of F2 intensity, occurred at a farm one mile south of Fredonia.  About $250,000 damage occurred at this farmstead alone, where a 70 foot tall concrete silo was sheared in two. Elsewhere along the track, barns were flattened, a garage was turned sideways, and a roof was lifted off a house.  Scraps of building debris were blown over a mile.  A storage building at an appliance store was moved 20 to 30 feet, exposing new appliances for sale.  At one residence, a child was moved off its bed moments before a 2x4 blew through the window into the child's bedroom.  Damage to outdoor objects and equipment was extensive. A 1,000 gallon tank was blown away, and grain bins were moved. Fences and satellite dishes were destroyed. Damage to expensive farm equipment, such as combines and hay balers, was moderate. Along wooded sections of the damage path, every tree was snapped or uprooted. Utility poles were snapped or blown over.

There were at least two separate occurrences in the Oak Grove area with another occurring adjacent to the Fort Campbell air field. A 52 MPH wind was reported at the air field, although it was not thought to be in the direct path of the funnel cloud. Some descriptions sounded like the funnel clouds formed in conjunction with towering cumulus clouds instead of cumulonimbus clouds (thunderstorms). Nobody remembered hearing any thunder although a minority reported some rain. A television station in Hopkinsville obtained videotape of the Oak Grove tornado. The primary damage was in a mobile home park, where a mobile home was overturned and destroyed. Two occupants of the mobile home were slightly injured, but did not require treatment at any hospital. Other mobile homes in the park were slightly damaged. An estimated 130,000 dollars damage occurred at the Fort Campbell Army Post due to a brief funnel touchdown.

The tornado tracked northeast through the heart of Owensboro before dissipating on the east side of town. Peak winds were estimated at 180 MPH. Since the tornado path was mostly through densely populated residential and commercial areas, damage was in the tens of millions, but injuries were surprisingly few. Of the 18 injuries, one was critical, and the rest were relatively minor. The critically injured person was in a home near the beginning of the damage path. This person sustained broken vertebrae and numerous cuts and bruises. Owensboro landmarks  heavily damaged by the tornado included Apollo High School, Kentucky Wesleyan College, and the Winn-Dixie Store.  Damage to the 12 buildings at Kentucky Wesleyan College was estimated to be near 5 million dollars. Small to mid size automobiles were tossed about by the wind. Damage to utility lines was extensive, and repairs took about 10 days to complete. Final damage tallies showed about 1200 homes and businesses sustained damage. Of those 1200 structures, 101 were totally destroyed and 573 sustained major damage. Owensboro was declared a federal disaster area. An emergency shelter accomodated roughly 150 persons, including many from local nursing homes. Owensboro schools were closed for a week.","EPISODE_NARRATIVE":"","ABSOLUTE_ROWNUMBER":"152"},{"EVENT_ID":"5139332","CZ_NAME_STR":"WASHINGTON CO.","BEGIN_LOCATION":"WILLISBURG","BEGIN_DATE":"04/20/2000","BEGIN_TIME":"1755","EVENT_TYPE":"Tornado","MAGNITUDE":" ","TOR_F_SCALE":"F1","DEATHS_DIRECT":"0","INJURIES_DIRECT":"4","DAMAGE_PROPERTY_NUM":"70000","DAMAGE_CROPS_NUM":"0","STATE_ABBR":"KY","CZ_TIMEZONE":"EST","MAGNITUDE_TYPE":" ","EPISODE_ID":"1093574","CZ_TYPE":"C","CZ_FIPS":"229","WFO":"LMK","INJURIES_INDIRECT":"0","DEATHS_INDIRECT":"0","SOURCE":"NWS STORM SURVEY","FLOOD_CAUSE":" ","TOR_LENGTH":"1","TOR_WIDTH":"75","BEGIN_RANGE":"1","BEGIN_AZIMUTH":"N","END_RANGE":"2","END_AZIMUTH":"NE","END_LOCATION":"WILLISBURG","END_DATE":"04/20/2000","END_TIME":"1757","BEGIN_LAT":"37.78","BEGIN_LON":"-85.12","END_LAT":"37.82","END_LON":"-85.08","EVENT_NARRATIVE":"The tornado destroyed two mobile homes and a tobacco barn.

A series of intense downbursts with peak winds up to 120 MPH struck northern Daviess County. The severe damage was concentrated in a 5-mile wide path from Stanley through Owensboro to Yelvington. Approximately 40 to 50 houses received major damage, mostly due to trees falling on them. Another 40 to 50 homes received minor damage. Several barns and garages were destroyed. A house roof was blown off. Hundreds of downed trees, power lines, and power poles blocked numerous roads. A woman was trapped in her vehicle when a tree fell on it. An irrigation rig was overturned in the Stanley area, and at least one trailer was blown off its foundation. Debris and even a whole building blocked roads in the Stanley area of Daviess County. Damage in Union and Henderson Counties consisted of widespread tree damage. Trees were down across many primary roads, including the Pennyrile Parkway and U.S. Highways 41 and 60. A National Weather Service damage survey estimated peak winds near Geneva in Henderson County were near 75 MPH. At Geneva, numerous trees were down, a sun room was blown off a house, and there was minor structural damage such as broken windows and shingles off roofs. One large tree limb fell through the wall of a house. A survey of the damage in eastern Henderson County revealed a very short-track tornado near Spottsville.

The tornado moved east-northeast across central Christian County, passing less than four miles north of downtown Hopkinsville, before crossing into Todd County less than a mile north of Pilot Rock. Near the beginning of the damage path, a church was levelled. Across the county, 91 homes were destroyed, and another 171 homes sustained varying degrees of damage. Several people were pulled from the debris of their homes during a door-to-door search that lasted into the next morning. Of the 22 people directly injured by the tornado, 17 were checked in at the local hospital, and five were transferred to regional hospitals. Another ten or so people received injuries not directly inflicted by the tornado, such as driving into fallen trees. None of the injuries, which consisted mostly of cuts, bruises, and fractures, were considered life-threatening. Numerous garages, barns, and outbuildings were destroyed. Some vehicles were damaged or destroyed. Hundreds of trees were downed, snapped, or uprooted. Power was out to most of the city of Hopkinsville for about six hours as a result of downed steel towers that carry primary transmission lines. Peak winds were estimated near 185 MPH. The average path width was 500 yards. It should be noted that the initial tornado reformed or reorganized about 7 miles northeast of Hopkinsville, leaving a break in the tornado path less than a mile long. Downburst wind damage occurred both north and south of the area where the tornado reorganized, resulting in a two-mile wide swath of damage along Highway 107. The webcam at the local hospital captured the tornado as it passed north of downtown Hopkinsville.","EPISODE_NARRATIVE":"","ABSOLUTE_ROWNUMBER":"144"},{"EVENT_ID":"5501850","CZ_NAME_STR":"TODD CO.","BEGIN_LOCATION":"ALLEGRE","BEGIN_DATE":"04/02/2006","BEGIN_TIME":"2011","EVENT_TYPE":"Tornado","MAGNITUDE":" ","TOR_F_SCALE":"F2","DEATHS_DIRECT":"0","INJURIES_DIRECT":"6","DAMAGE_PROPERTY_NUM":"2500000","DAMAGE_CROPS_NUM":"0","STATE_ABBR":"KY","CZ_TIMEZONE":"CST","MAGNITUDE_TYPE":" ","EPISODE_ID":"1207447","CZ_TYPE":"C","CZ_FIPS":"219","WFO":"PAH","INJURIES_INDIRECT":"0","DEATHS_INDIRECT":"0","SOURCE":"NWS STORM SURVEY","FLOOD_CAUSE":" ","TOR_LENGTH":"10.2","TOR_WIDTH":"150","BEGIN_RANGE":"4","BEGIN_AZIMUTH":"W","END_RANGE":"3","END_AZIMUTH":"E","END_LOCATION":"CEDAR GROVE","END_DATE":"04/02/2006","END_TIME":"2023","BEGIN_LAT":"36.93","BEGIN_LON":"-87.28","END_LAT":"36.93","END_LON":"-87.10","EVENT_NARRATIVE":"The tornado continued into Todd County from Christian County, crossing the county line near Pilot Rock.

Peak winds in this area were estimated near 115 mph. The EF-2 tornado damaged or destroyed several pole barns along U.S. Highway 51. One barn was over 100 feet long and was anchored by telephone poles set in concrete. Most of the poles were snapped. A few poles were pulled up, with one thrown about 50 yards. A section of U.S. 51 was closed due to downed power poles and debris. Large trees were uprooted or snapped. There was minor house damage. As the tornado continued northeast across Kentucky Highway 1070 and a nearby road, three homes were damaged. One of the houses sustained damage to an outside wall, which was pushed in about three inches. The carport attached to that wall was blown away. A two-story garage was destroyed, along with other sheds and another carport. The other two houses sustained damage to garages and siding. Windows were blown out, and a section of roof was blown off one house. The maximum path width of about 600 yards was in this area. The average path width was closer to 300 yards.

In the buildings most heavily damaged, parts of supporting walls made from cinder blocks collapsed.  Christ Church, located on the Churchill Downs property, also had roof and siding damage. After snapping trees and downing power lines for several blocks to the east of Churchill, the tornado crossed a large stadium parking lot, strengthening to low-end EF-2 intensity near the intersection of Floyd Street and Central Avenue. At this location, just 300 yards southeast of the University of Louisville's football stadium, a large industrial building was heavily damaged, with a collapsed 2-story cinder block wall and a 150-foot section of roof removed from the warehouse.  A 30' x 80' section of roof over an adjacent office building was also torn off.   The tornado downed several more trees and did minor roof damage to a Super 8 Motel and other office buildings before lifting north of the intersection of Crittenden Drive and Central Avenue near an entrance ramp onto Interstate 65. ||Despite the most heavily damaged Churchill Downs buildings being occupied by numerous racing horses and at least three workers at the time of the tornado, no injuries were sustained by either the animals or their handlers.

In all, three episodes of heavy thunderstorms contributed to localized flash flooding across north central Kentucky, including Louisville, Lexington, and in Madison County.  The last two episodes, arriving during the late-afternoon and late-evening hours, brought wind damage, flooding and one long-tracked strong tornado in LaRue County.  At the beginning of the day, Kentucky lay in a very humid airmass, with dewpoints in the lower 70s. During the pre-dawn hours, the remains of a decaying nocturnal mesoscale convective system brought widespread substantial rains to Louisville and areas eastward along and north of Interstate 64 towards Frankfort.  Some areas in metropolitan Louisville received over 1 inch of rain.  This convective system didn't penetrate very far into Kentucky before dissipating, leaving an undisturbed airmass for later in the afternoon.  A second wave of storms moved southeast across the same area during the mid-afternoon hours. These were surface-based and brought localized flash flooding and wind damage. The final round of storms moved southeast of the Ohio River near and southwest of Louisville around mid-evening, supported by a strong digging shortwave moving southeast across Illinois.  This final round of storms brought additional flash flooding, damaging winds, and a tornado.","ABSOLUTE_ROWNUMBER":"122"},{"EVENT_ID":"452171","CZ_NAME_STR":"TRIGG CO.","BEGIN_LOCATION":"TRIGG FURNACE","BEGIN_DATE":"07/06/2013","BEGIN_TIME":"1850","EVENT_TYPE":"Tornado","MAGNITUDE":" ","TOR_F_SCALE":"EF0","DEATHS_DIRECT":"0","INJURIES_DIRECT":"0","DAMAGE_PROPERTY_NUM":"5000","DAMAGE_CROPS_NUM":"0","STATE_ABBR":"KY","CZ_TIMEZONE":"CST-6","MAGNITUDE_TYPE":" ","EPISODE_ID":"74782","CZ_TYPE":"C","CZ_FIPS":"221","WFO":"PAH","INJURIES_INDIRECT":"0","DEATHS_INDIRECT":"0","SOURCE":"Trained Spotter","FLOOD_CAUSE":" ","TOR_LENGTH":"0.89","TOR_WIDTH":"50","BEGIN_RANGE":"2","BEGIN_AZIMUTH":"SSW","END_RANGE":"2","END_AZIMUTH":"S","END_LOCATION":"TRIGG FURNACE","END_DATE":"07/06/2013","END_TIME":"1851","BEGIN_LAT":"36.8525","BEGIN_LON":"-87.9311","END_LAT":"36.8558","END_LON":"-87.9154","EVENT_NARRATIVE":"A trained spotter witnessed a tornado move into Lake Barkley State Resort Park.

However, across much of Kentucky and southern Indiana, widespread cloudiness held temperatures in the mid 60s and severely limited surface-based instability during the afternoon.||In west central Kentucky, a broken line of storms developed. Some of these developed persistent rotation and brought several tornadoes to the western portion of the state. One circulation moved into Butler County, and eventually produced an EF-1 tornado across the central portion of the county. ||Across northern Kentucky, along the Ohio River, widespread soaking rains developed during the pre-dawn hours and continued through mid-morning. Heavy tropical showers trained over a strip of counties right along the Ohio River, including Jefferson, Meade, and Oldham Counties. Some locations received locally over 3 inches of rain in a 5 hour period. Some minor urban flooding inconvenienced several motorists.","ABSOLUTE_ROWNUMBER":"145"},{"EVENT_ID":"483158","CZ_NAME_STR":"CALLOWAY CO.","BEGIN_LOCATION":"WADESBORO","BEGIN_DATE":"12/21/2013","BEGIN_TIME":"1731","EVENT_TYPE":"Tornado","MAGNITUDE":" ","TOR_F_SCALE":"EF0","DEATHS_DIRECT":"0","INJURIES_DIRECT":"0","DAMAGE_PROPERTY_NUM":"2000","DAMAGE_CROPS_NUM":"0","STATE_ABBR":"KY","CZ_TIMEZONE":"CST-6","MAGNITUDE_TYPE":" ","EPISODE_ID":"80726","CZ_TYPE":"C","CZ_FIPS":"35","WFO":"PAH","INJURIES_INDIRECT":"0","DEATHS_INDIRECT":"0","SOURCE":"NWS Storm Survey","FLOOD_CAUSE":" ","TOR_LENGTH":"0.33","TOR_WIDTH":"50","BEGIN_RANGE":"1","BEGIN_AZIMUTH":"S","END_RANGE":"1","END_AZIMUTH":"SSE","END_LOCATION":"WADESBORO","END_DATE":"12/21/2013","END_TIME":"1732","BEGIN_LAT":"36.7343","BEGIN_LON":"-88.3178","END_LAT":"36.7346","END_LON":"-88.3119","EVENT_NARRATIVE":"A relatively weak tornado touched down 2 miles west of Dexter in northern Calloway County.

Finally, it pushed an achored mobile home off its foundation - ripping the anchors out of the ground - and damaged outbuildings along Long Lick Road before lifting.","EPISODE_NARRATIVE":"A deep closed low near Hudson's Bay on October 7th brought cyclonic flow to the Lower Ohio Valley.

This location is south of Butler and northwest of Falmouth in Pendleton County. A mobile home originally anchored into the ground at 8-10 points was tilted and briefly lifted before rolling onto its top on the east side of Bethel Loop. The three residents sustained minor injuries requiring overnight hospitalization. Debris from the mobile home was carried downwind for approximately one-tenth of a mile. The debris field remained confined to a narrow path as it tapered to the east-northeast. This seemed indicative of convergent motion associated with the circulation. There were also several 6-8 inch trees snapped immediately west of the mobile home. This is likely where the first touchdown occurred. The tornado then lifted. The next damage location was a metal barn on Ashcraft Road. The entire roof was lifted and removed from the barn. The roof measured approximately 60 feet by 30 feet and the barn was relatively new (construction within the last 10 years). The roof was carried into adjacent trees immediately northeast of the structure. There was minor damage to a smaller barn just northwest of the path center line. The homeowner also described a dock approximately 15 square feet that was pulled from its anchor and moved north-northeast across a pond toward the center line of the path. All of this damage indicated a convergent and lifting motion associated with the tornado. The tornado then lifted again, as damage was next observed along Route 609 just south of the intersection with Davis Road. One barn west of Route 609 was destroyed and a tree approximately 20 inches in diameter immediately east of the road was snapped at the trunk and fell against a residence. Debris was carried between one and two tenths of a mile to the northeast. Another barn just to the north was partially destroyed. Tornadic damage was not as conclusive at this location, but debris was confined to a narrow path likely due to convergent wind motion. A number of trees were snapped to the northeast along Davis Road. Trees ranged in diameter from 8 to 16 inches. The clearest evidence of circulation on the ground was located along Route 159 where several types of damage occurred at a residence south of the intersection with Davis Road. The roof was partially removed from the residence and some of the insulation was dispersed to the west and spattered against the west side of the house. Insulation was also spattered on trees immediately to the northwest. Heavy sections of metal fencing from a horse corral were lifted and carried approximately 50 yards to the west. Both of these debris fields were carried and deposited opposite the storm motion. A number of trees just north and south of the residence were also snapped. The tornado lifted again before touching down one last time. The final damage was found along Hickory Grove Road, south of the intersection with Route 10. This is the estimated end of the tornado path. A camper was lifted to the north-northeast approximately 10-15 feet over trees before being dropped and destroyed. There was also minor structural damage at two nearby mobile homes. This damage consisted of garage doors blown inward and some roof damage.","EPISODE_NARRATIVE":"A squall line developed ahead of an ejecting upper system over the lower Ohio Valley and raced northeast into the region.

The tornado was captured on video or camera by numerous individuals. The tornado appeared to have more than one vortex at several different points along its path. The tornado moved through some residential and commercial neighborhoods just outside the northern city limits of Mayfield. A car dealership on U.S. Highway 45 right near the city limit received extensive damage, including the loss of almost all 40 vehicles on the lot as well as a nearby storage building. The peak wind speed of 140 mph was assigned at this car lot. A flea market type of business on Highway 121 just outside Mayfield was destroyed by winds near 135 mph. Once the tornado reached the northern edge of Mayfield, it tracked almost parallel to the Purchase Parkway (future Interstate 69). The center of the tornado stayed about one-half mile north of the parkway, crossing Kentucky Highways 131 and 301 prior to reaching the Marshall County line. The average path width was approximately 300 yards. Peak wind speeds were estimated near 140 mph.

The tornado tracked within a couple of miles either side of U.S. Highway 62 for most of its path in McCracken County. The tornado intermittently reached EF-2 intensity from the Ballard County line to about two miles southeast of Barkley Regional Airport. A total of 25 dwellings were damaged along the path in McCracken County. Five businesses were damaged, and 20 residences were damaged. The damage was categorized as minor for 14 of the residences, major for one, and five were destroyed. Major structural damage included partial loss of roofs or walls. Minor damage to homes included the loss of shingles. Dozens of barns, outbuildings, garages, or grain bins were destroyed.  A church, located on U.S. Highway 62 near Highway 305, lost much of the roof structure as well as a large part of a second story exterior wall. This is where the tornado reached its maximum intensity, with estimated peak winds near 125 mph. A total of 40 pre-schoolers were inside a day care facility in the church, but none were directly injured. At least ten vehicles sustained damage in this area near the church. The only injury occurred on U.S. Highway 62 near the church, where a grain bin was blown on top of a pickup truck traveling eastbound. During the final few miles of its track, the tornado weakened as it moved through the western part of the city of Paducah. In the western part of Paducah, the tornado moved across U.S. Highway 60 and the city's main shopping mall. The tornado dissipated shortly after crossing Interstate 24 between exits 3 and 4. The roofs of the shopping mall and a nearby strip mall were damaged. Several businesses in the mall area and along Interstate 24 sustained minor damage, mostly to roofs. Windows were blown out of vehicles and buildings. A moving semi truck was lifted along Interstate 24 and was blown into the median in a jack-knife position. Along the entire track, dozens of utility poles were down, causing extensive power outages for nearly 10,000 customers. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. Video of the tornado was captured by personnel at the Paducah National Weather Service office, which the tornado missed by about two miles.","EPISODE_NARRATIVE":"A strong low pressure system produced multiple weather hazards.

There was significant straight line wind damage across much of the county facing an easterly and southeasterly direction. Interspersed with the straight line wind damage was at least one tornado across western Allen County north of and paralleling KY 585.||The tornado touched down near the Horseshoe Ford Road and Horseshoe Bend Road intersection. There were numerous large hardwood trees split, twisted, and uprooted facing from northerly to southeasterly. Horseshoe Bend Road was closed due to trees down across the road and from flooding. Winds in this area were estimated to be between 90 and 95 mph. Further east along Mayhew Road a large, well-built barn|was uplifted and removed from its foundation with several cedar and maple trees twisted and snapped. Across a farmer's field, corn was flattened and twisted in multiple directions. Large, heavy fuel tanks were rolled in two different directions on Mayhew Road. Several barns and outbuilding had roof damage as well.||At the Mayhew and Pope Road intersection there was extensive softwood and hardwood tree damage, especially around the Harmony|Missionary Baptist Church at 5226 Pope Road.

Radar supports this ground analysis with mesovortices along the leading edge of the potent squall line. The width of the individual circulations varied between 75 and 125 yards with widespread straight line wind damage all around.  Most of the wind damage was between 85 and 95 mph.||More tree and power line damage was along KY 585 near Shores Road.

There were two significant areas of straight line wind damage. There was a barn north of Amos on Highway 99. The second was two large barns just north of Hayesville, TN. ||Interspersed among the straight line wind damage was a tornado which first touched down a half mile east of Amos. A family farm had numerous trees twisted, snapped, and uprooted. Several barns sustained severe structural damage to the roofs. A dozen or so portions of two by fours were impaled into the ground in multiple directions. ||Further southeast on Highland Church Road numerous trees were uprooted and snapped with trees facing from the north northeast to the southeast direction.

The owner of the house was upstairs sleeping, when he heard his ears popping, then a large roar of wind on top of the house and bricks fell on his bed. Surprisingly he sustained no injuries. The tornado then moved across a mixture of open farm fields and scattered forest. There is a significant swath of tree damage between Fairfield Road and Murrays Run Road, with trees uprooted, snapped, and twisted. Thanks to a nelson county drone you could clearly see trees laying in multiple directions. ||The tornado hit a property on Murrays Run Road ripping off the sides of a large well-built barn. The back part of the barn was thrown to the west while a wagon in the trailer was pushed out through the barn. A 72' x 12' shed next to the barn was destroyed. Parts of that barn were impaled into the ground 75 to 80 yards down wind. The tornado was at its widest at 45 yards here with 95 mph winds. Another remarkable thing is the family house was only 60 yards from the damage path, and did not lose even a shingle on the house. Across the street the tornado did extensive roof damage to a family house and barn, uplifting several large parts of it. Debris from the barn was thrown up to 300 yards downwind and in many different directions. The family said that they heard all the doors in the house shut tightly and heard a distinct roar. The tornado produced sporadic damage across farmland mainly in terms of trees, with more concentrated damage along Plum Run Road. Cedar tree damage was rather extensive with many cedars being snapped and twisted. Winds were around 90 mph here with a width of 40 yards. The tornado destroyed an old barn on Chester Hahn Road but weakened to an EF-0 of 80 mph and ended with a few snapped trees before Dugan Lane.","EPISODE_NARRATIVE":"A strong storm system moved from the Midwest into the lower Ohio Valley on April 8, 2020.

Several homes received shingle damage, along with snapped and uprooted trees. ||A large RV protective carport was picked up and thrown about 50 yards, and subsequently a telephone pole was sheared off. A single wide mobile home was pushed off of its cinder block foundation to the southwest about 7 feet. Another mobile home sustained roof damage, and there was also significant rock and mud spatter against three sides of the mobile home. Winds were estimated to be a maximum of 85 mph in this area with a width of 50 yards. ||There were a number of cedar trees sheared off half way up the trees. Metal siding was thrown downwind up to 500 yards into the forest.
