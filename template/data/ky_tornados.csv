This location is south of Butler and northwest of Falmouth in Pendleton County. A mobile home originally anchored into the ground at 8-10 points was tilted and briefly lifted before rolling onto its top on the east side of Bethel Loop. The three residents sustained minor injuries requiring overnight hospitalization. Debris from the mobile home was carried downwind for approximately one-tenth of a mile. The debris field remained confined to a narrow path as it tapered to the east-northeast. This seemed indicative of convergent motion associated with the circulation. There were also several 6-8 inch trees snapped immediately west of the mobile home. This is likely where the first touchdown occurred. The tornado then lifted. The next damage location was a metal barn on Ashcraft Road. The entire roof was lifted and removed from the barn. The roof measured approximately 60 feet by 30 feet and the barn was relatively new (construction within the last 10 years). The roof was carried into adjacent trees immediately northeast of the structure. There was minor damage to a smaller barn just northwest of the path center line. The homeowner also described a dock approximately 15 square feet that was pulled from its anchor and moved north-northeast across a pond toward the center line of the path. All of this damage indicated a convergent and lifting motion associated with the tornado. The tornado then lifted again, as damage was next observed along Route 609 just south of the intersection with Davis Road. One barn west of Route 609 was destroyed and a tree approximately 20 inches in diameter immediately east of the road was snapped at the trunk and fell against a residence. Debris was carried between one and two tenths of a mile to the northeast. Another barn just to the north was partially destroyed. Tornadic damage was not as conclusive at this location, but debris was confined to a narrow path likely due to convergent wind motion. A number of trees were snapped to the northeast along Davis Road. Trees ranged in diameter from 8 to 16 inches. The clearest evidence of circulation on the ground was located along Route 159 where several types of damage occurred at a residence south of the intersection with Davis Road. The roof was partially removed from the residence and some of the insulation was dispersed to the west and spattered against the west side of the house. Insulation was also spattered on trees immediately to the northwest. Heavy sections of metal fencing from a horse corral were lifted and carried approximately 50 yards to the west. Both of these debris fields were carried and deposited opposite the storm motion. A number of trees just north and south of the residence were also snapped. The tornado lifted again before touching down one last time. The final damage was found along Hickory Grove Road, south of the intersection with Route 10. This is the estimated end of the tornado path. A camper was lifted to the north-northeast approximately 10-15 feet over trees before being dropped and destroyed. There was also minor structural damage at two nearby mobile homes. This damage consisted of garage doors blown inward and some roof damage.","A squall line developed ahead of an ejecting upper system over the lower Ohio Valley and raced northeast into the region.

Never more than 50 yards wide, the first evidence of the tornado touching down was one mile south of the water tower on Thomas Lane, where it downed several large branches that blocked the road. Moving northeast over forested land, the next evidence was more tree trunks and branches snapped on Poplar Grove Rd just north of the intersection with Hilldale Rd. The tornado then continued to skip northeast, snapping branches and trunks to the west of Frank Luttrell Rd, before crossing the road and causing minor roof damage to the metal roof of a barn and snapping more tree limbs a third of a mile southeast of North Hancock Elementary School. The tornado dropped small branches and leaves along its path as it continued northeast. The last major tree damage was observed around a home on Adair Rd, where trees were uprooted and trunks snapped in a cyclonic pattern around the home. The only damage to the home, however, was minor roof damage from a branch falling on it. The storm then crossed Adair Rd, lifting somewhere in a wooded area west of a large pond near Beauchamp Lane, where residents witnessed its dissipation.","On September 5, 2018, the remnants of Tropical Storm Gordon moved north from the Gulf of Mexico. It carried copious amounts of moisture as it continued to rotate while slowly moving north.  In Kentucky, the outer bands of the system brought showers and thunderstorms that produced isolated wind damage September 5 and 6.   By September 8th, Gordon was centered in southeast Missouri with much of its moisture and energy in the Ohio River Valley interacted with a stationary front. This produced efficient rainfall that caused flash flooding, and the environmental shear was strong enough to produce two tornadoes along the Ohio River in southern Indiana and north-central Kentucky.",341

It did minor roof damage to two homes, tossed a trampoline into a neighboring home, causing siding damage, and pushed a large travel trailer onto a minivan, heavily damaging both. Mud was spattered onto the north-facing front of the home, where a porch column support was also moved slightly.  From here it traveled east-northeast, snapping tree limbs as it skipped over mainly open pastureland until it reached Thomas Rd. ||On the west side of Thomas Road, the tornado reached its greatest intensities and size, with winds of 100 mph and a path width of 80 yards. Here it damaged four outbuildings, completely destroying two - the largest being a 30 x 50 structure. The debris pattern from the four outbuildings and nearby trees with snapped trunks and limbs showed clear cyclonic rotation. Metal roofing and siding material was scattered nearly a quarter of a mile to the east- northeast, with some of it lofted into the trees of a heavily wooded area. Other building debris from the largest structure was blown to the northwest, and the south and east-facing walls of a number of structures were spattered with leaves and other ground-based vegetation. Three east-facing garage doors of one of the outbuildings were blown in, and damage sustained to the vehicles in the driveway from downed tree limbs. Three homes in the area sustained roof and siding damage, including a 2x4 from one of the outbuildings blown through an exterior wall. ||The tornado became elevated as it continued east-northeast from Thomas Rd, snapping a few tree limbs in a wooded area before briefly touching down one last time on Rineyville Rd, where it littered the highway with tree limbs and tore the front porch off a home, vaulting the roof over the house into the back yard. Security cameras from a business next door captured the damage occurring as a wall of wind and water that occurred in less than half a minute. No further damage occurred to the east of this location as the tornado dissipated. NWS was assisted in the storm survey by Hardin County Emergency Management.","Large scale lift and moisture transport were in place beneath the right entrance region of an upper level jet situated between a central U.S. trough and an Atlantic Coast ridge.

To the north of the barn and home, it tossed a 1500 lb. hay roll southeast over a fence. From here, the tornado raced east-northeast over more fields, where it snapped the tops off a few trees before it hit the next farm, at Milky Way Lane on Mt. Carmel Road. Here it destroyed one large outbuilding and tore much of the roof off another in addition to destroying two small grain hoppers. Flying debris damaged at least two other buildings and vehicles, with roofing debris scattered a quarter of a mile to the northeast. Across the road from these buildings, the tornado tore the roof off and partially collapsed the wall of another large outbuilding. Flying debris from this building damaged another outbuilding, while columns on the southwest-facing front porch of the farm home were blown out as the porch roof was briefly elevated.||The tornado continued eastward, snapping the trunks of several large trees along Butler Creek and damaging carports and a metal outbuilding along Holmes Bend Rd and Turkey Trace.

There were a couple of snapped and uprooted trees in the forest, but the most impressive damage was just beyond the small wooded area where a very noticeable ground grinding swirl could be seen across the farmers field. It measured approximately 40 yards wide, which was seen very clearly from a NWS aerial drone. ||There were no signs of any damage beyond the farmers field, where the swirls ended abruptly.","Early in the day, low level wind shear was very strong. A stable layer over the area allowed a warm front to bring sunshine and warmer temperatures to the region, but the warming surface temperatures caused the stable layer to erode and become unstable. The high shear environment allowed storms, ahead of a cold front, to become severe and severe hail, damaging winds, and three tornadoes resulted.",413

The tornado touched down about a half mile west of 1598 Carter Brothers Road. Aerial photography from a NOAA NWS drone shows distinct swirls along several farmers' properties with damage to a half dozen barns and numerous uprooted and snapped trees. Cedar trees were the most common tree that sustained damage during this tornado. ||At 1598 Carter Brothers Rd, a riding lawn mower was thrown about 50 yards and a garbage can flew 150 yards. There were snapped, twisted, and uprooted trees facing in nearly every direction. Winds at this location were between 90 and 95 miles an hour. ||There were indications that this was an intermittent skipping tornado. Along Dan Dunn Road several barns sustained significant roof and sidewall damage, and a 50 foot by 50 foot chain link fence was bent at 90 degrees along every support post.||The most significant damage of the tornado path was found at 3000 Slack Rd. It destroyed two barns and did significant roof and siding damage to a well-built one-story residential home. Insulation and metal siding were thrown in multiple directions. At the end of the property, aerial drone photography showed trees going in nearly every direction. Wind speeds in this location were estimated to be 100 mph. Residents at the house said they could feel the intense pressure and everything trying to suck out of the house. ||On the way to the next storm damage survey we found sporadic straight line wind damage in Hardin County. This included three mobile homes that sustained roof damage near the Hardin County Fairgrounds.","Early in the day, low level wind shear was very strong.

It quickly became severe in southwest Monroe County and became tornadic on the southwest side of Tompkinsville. The tornado touched down near the intersection of Second and Jackson Streets. Trees were lying in multiple directions and most of them were twisted, snapped, or uprooted. Power lines were down, and several power poles were snapped. Winds at that location were between 85 and 90 mph with a width of 50 yards. ||Farther to the northeast, between 5th Street and Carter Street, the tornado increased to 95 mph and the width expanded out to 60 yards. Several homes experienced roof damage with some windows blown out. One home had multiple large trees uprooted with a camper trailer and pontoon boat flipped over. There were several pieces of lumber that were impaled in the ground and pieces of sheet metal thrown into trees. ||The US Bank building received roof damage before the tornado briefly lifted before touching down near the intersection of Pedigo and White Streets. ||There was significant tree damage on the east of Main Street by Pedigo Street. Trees were facing multiple directions. Mud spatter was on the backside of homes and vehicles along Short Street to Monroe Street. Multiple power lines were down in the area. Winds decreased to 90 mph along Monroe Street. ||The National Weather Service drone found some twisted tree tops near Spring Valley Road and Woodhaven as a result of wind speeds of 85 mph. The tornado lifted at Jackie Crow Salvage Yard as it threw debris on top of a hill about 250 yards from the salvage yard.  ||Several videos showed brief funnels coming down from the main storm, almost like a small skipping tornado.","Early on May 3rd, central Kentucky sat in the warm sector ahead of an approaching surface low. Much of the region saw only rain showers, but one isolated cell in southern Kentucky was able to produce a short lived EF-1 tornado in the city of Tompkinsville, KY. ||On May 4th, a cold front, following the first system, produced additional rain showers and thunderstorms on the already saturated ground.
