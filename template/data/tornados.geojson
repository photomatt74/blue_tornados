A dairy barn with 45 cows inside was destroyed. Although all the cows were trapped under the collapsed barn, only two of the cows were injured. One of the cows was thrown 500 feet from its stall. Numerous large trees were snapped or uprooted. A tractor-trailer rig hauling freight was overturned at mile-marker 85 on Interstate 24. The driver suffered minor injuries and was taken to a regional hospital. The roof was torn from an agricultural chemical storage building. A tool barn was destroyed. At a farm near Pembroke, a large tree fell on a house, a large barn was flattened, and two large grain bins were destroyed. Peak winds were estimated near 120 mph, but the majority of the damage path was EF-1. The average path width was 150 yards.",

The activity was closely related to a mid-level shortwave trough moving across Iowa and Missouri, along with a low level wind maximum. The storms were associated with isolated large hail, damaging winds, and a tornado.",

            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "This tornado touched down just southwest of an area of horse barns on the south side of Churchill Downs. Five barns, which also contained apartments for many workers, had major sections of their roofs removed, with minor damage to several others. In the buildings most heavily damaged, parts of supporting walls made from cinder blocks collapsed.  Christ Church, located on the Churchill Downs property, also had roof and siding damage. After snapping trees and downing power lines for several blocks to the east of Churchill, the tornado crossed a large stadium parking lot, strengthening to low-end EF-2 intensity near the intersection of Floyd Street and Central Avenue. At this location, just 300 yards southeast of the University of Louisville's football stadium, a large industrial building was heavily damaged, with a collapsed 2-story cinder block wall and a 150-foot section of roof removed from the warehouse.  A 30' x 80' section of roof over an adjacent office building was also torn off.   The tornado downed several more trees and did minor roof damage to a Super 8 Motel and other office buildings before lifting north of the intersection of Crittenden Drive and Central Avenue near an entrance ramp onto Interstate 65. ||Despite the most heavily damaged Churchill Downs buildings being occupied by numerous racing horses and at least three workers at the time of the tornado, no injuries were sustained by either the animals or their handlers.  One man was in an upstairs room when the roof above him was ripped off, while two others were in in a ground-floor apartment where cinder blocks fell from an exterior wall.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A deep occluded closed low across the Upper Midwest brought a cold front and wind shift along the Ohio River during the early evening hours on June 22nd. Scattered storms developed to the west of Louisville during the late afternoon and intensified as they moved east into Jefferson County, Kentucky. Although instability was marginal, a jet streak aloft combined with directional wind shear closer the the surface allowed several low topped supercells to develop just to the west of Louisville. The first storm generated a tornado that damaged several horse barns at Churchill Downs and destroyed a large industrial building just southeast of the University of Louisville's football stadium.  A second rotating supercell tracked just to the south of the first storm, spawning three brief tornadoes along a west to east path in the eastern part of the Louisville Metro area.",

            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "This tornado was the first of three separate touchdowns associated with a single supercell that tracked across the southern portion of Jefferson County.  Initially, this tornado touched down at EF-0 strength near the intersection of Nachand Lane and Nachand Spring Lane where minor shingle damage and snapped trees were surveyed. After moving into the Hurstbourne Woods subdivision, the twister damaged a locked pool gate and blew it 35 yards downwind. This subdivision sustained EF-1 damage with gutters, soffits, and siding from various structures deposited in trees. At 9407 Willowwood Way, roof damage was noted, along with many uprooted hardwood and softwood trees. After making a brief 25 degree northward turn near the end of its life, the tornado brought minor roof damage before lifting near the intersection of Lisa Lane and Calais Drive.",

Scattered storms developed to the west of Louisville during the late afternoon and intensified as they moved east into Jefferson County, Kentucky. Although instability was marginal, a jet streak aloft combined with directional wind shear closer the the surface allowed several low topped supercells to develop just to the west of Louisville. The first storm generated a tornado that damaged several horse barns at Churchill Downs and destroyed a large industrial building just southeast of the University of Louisville's football stadium.  A second rotating supercell tracked just to the south of the first storm, spawning three brief tornadoes along a west to east path in the eastern part of the Louisville Metro area.",

The twister first touched down just east of the intersection of Interstate 264 and Brownsboro Road.  It did considerable roof damage to many homes to the south of Brownsboro Road and snapped numerous large trees which toppled onto the heavily traveled roadway near Ten Broeck Way.  After briefly lifting over a shopping complex near the intersection of Brownsboro and Hurstbourne Roads, the tornado touched down again, tearing a large exterior wall from an indoor tennis facility, then flipped two semi trailers as it crossed Interstate 265, injuring the driver of one.  After crossing the interstate, it continued to skip northeast for another 4 miles into Oldham County, doing primarily roof damage in addition to snapping and uprooting taller trees. The last major damage occurred near the corner of Ballardsville Rd and Murphy Lane, where the roof of a large horse barn was partially torn off.",

A strong cold front crossed southern Indiana during the early afternoon. Ahead of this boundary, a squall line fueled by temperatures in the lower 60s with dewpoints in the upper 50s moved across the Ohio River during the late morning. This line continued to the southeast, finally exiting central Kentucky near the lake Cumberland Area around mid-afternoon. This line of storms exhibited bowing segments and occasional mesovorticies that brought several tornadoes and scattered wind damage. The 9 tornadoes surveyed across both central Kentucky and southern Indiana made this episode the most prolific regional January tornado outbreak recorded.",

Near Oscar, a few barns and a machine shed were blown down. A porch was blown off a home. The tornado carved a damage path near Bandana and Oscar. One mobile home and one farm was destroyed near Bandana. Hundreds of trees were uprooted or snapped. Some homes sustained minor to moderate roof damage. Other homes received siding and gutter damage. Several power poles were snapped. Several chicken houses were damaged or destroyed. Peak winds were estimated near 120 mph. The average path width was 125 yards. The tornado continued into McCracken County.",

The storm increased in width to 200 yards and struck several single and double wide mobile homes south of Millerstown Road. All three mobile homes became airborne, with one traveling over 400 yards. One manufactured home, with a man inside, was thrown 50 feet into a tree and fence. The victim was medically airlifted to Louisville. The tornado next struck a large area of softwood and hardwood trees before striking a solid brick home just west of Horntown with the roof removed and exterior walls either damaged or destroyed. The tornado damaged the Horntown convenience store damaging the roof. During the end of the tornado's life cycle it narrowed and bounced striking several trees and knocking over several cemetery headstones, plus it uprooted 2 large trees at the Little Clifty United Methodist Church just west of Lacon. The tornado lifted in a grove of trees about 250 yards east of the church.",

It uprooted some cedar trees and damaged some fencing. This tornado then crossed Tanner Road and briefly lifted just west of downtown Hodgenville after staying on the ground for just less than one mile. The tornado then touched down again on the east side of Main Street near the State Farm Insurance Company and Citizen's Union Bank. At this point the tornado strengthened to an EF-2. Two cars were rotated and one was flipped onto the other in the State Farm parking lot. On Wobegone Way, the tornado widened to 200 yards and significantly damaged 3 homes, removing the roof and collapsing the exterior walls of one.  After entering a wooded area near Miami Court, it narrowed and became more elevated. It damaged many roofs with the heaviest damage occurring to a day care center. As the tornado crossed State Highway 210, it uprooted numerous trees and damaged several additional buildings.  It finally lifted around 80 yards east of Highway 210.

The tornado then crossed a heavily wooded area near the intersection of Routes 625 and 1838 and damaged some garage shingles. At this point, a second satellite vortex developed just to the south of the main circulation. It totally destroyed a barn on Rodgers Road and extensively damaged another. It severely  damaged a rugged forested area before merging with the path of the original tornado near the confluence of Corn Creek Road, Highway 625, and Joyce Mill Road. At this point, the tornado was rated an EF2 with 115 mph estimated winds. Three mobile homes near the intersection of Route 625 and Joyce Mill Road were destroyed along with extensive damage to power lines and poles.  Farther east, trees were damaged near Rawlett Lane.

The station was heavily damaged with the collapse of rigid frames.  A two ton concession trailer was moved 30 yards, while a pickup truck was moved 60 yards. Damage to the fire station and a pumper exceeded 300 thousand dollars. Damage to the station indicated 140 mph winds and a tornado with EF-3 intensity.  After extensively damaging many trees along Route 1226, the tornado weakened to an EF-1 at 871 Palmyra Road. ||At this point witnesses described one vortex lifting while another descended from its parent wall cloud. Rapidly strengthening to an EF-3, it destroyed several homes on Culls Road. One of these homes had collapsed exterior walls.

The EF1 damage in Carroll County began near the county line near the junction of East Prong Locust Road and Wrights Ridge Road. At this point the path width of the tornado had decreased to 150 yards. The path continued east northeast along Kings Ridge Road. The path then continued east northeast to Route 42 in the vicinity of Kemper Lane near the Harbor Pointe Estates community. The path briefly continued after that before diminishing. Damage in Carroll County was consistent with a high end EF0 to low end EF1 tornado. Several structures had minor to more significant roof damage, with some structures losing over 25 percent of the roof structure. Several barns were destroyed, as well as widespread hardwood tree damage. These trees were either snapped or uprooted. At least two mobile homes were destroyed.

This damage occurred at the west end of Barley Circle. Most of the damage in the rest of the subdivision was EF1 to EF2. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed of this tornado while in Grant County was estimated at 145 miles per hour. After traveling 1.33 miles on the ground in Grant County, the tornado then crossed into Kenton County at 1624 EST. Immediately as the tornado crossed west to east of Interstate 75, it strengthened to EF4 level. Five single family homes were destroyed down to their foundations in this area, with at least two of these homes having strapping or bolting to their foundations. The EF4 damage continued to the north end of Lexington Pike, where 2 homes and multiple outbuildings were completely destroyed. Both homes were brick structures with foundation bolting or strapping. The EF4 winds continued across Route 25 and ended near the Bagby Road area. At least 2 vehicles were carried, with one carried over 1800 feet. Trees were stripped of nearly all branches, with much of the bark also stripped. All 4 fatalities with this tornado occurred within the area of EF4 damage. As the tornado headed further to the east northeast, high end EF3 damage continued through other properties along Bagby Road, to Carlisle, Parker Grove, and Paxton Roads. Numerous double and single wide homes were destroyed, with both brick and siding structures left with collapsed exterior walls and either all or a large percentage of the roof removed. The tornado continued the east northeast path into southeast Kenton County, to the Licking River near Morning View. Damage in the Morning View area was consistent with EF1 to EF2 damage to near the Campbell County line, where the tornado lifted at 1632 EST after traveling 8.52 miles in Kenton County. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed from this tornado while in Kenton County was estimated at 175 miles per hour. This storm produced an earlier tornado in southern Indiana. Debris, possibly from that tornado, was later observed falling from the sky across Boone County, Kentucky.",

Power poles and trees were snapped, as well as a semi trailer overturned. The tornado then continued east across Kemper Lane where more barns were destroyed and numerous groves of trees were uprooted and snapped. The tornado lifted just east of Jonesville Road.

The tornado then crossed into Pendleton County at 1641 EST after producing high end EF3 damage along Reid Ridge Road near the Campbell and Pendleton County line. The tornado then moved across Mays Road producing significant and widespread EF2 to low end EF3 damage. The tornado then crossed AA highway and eventually the Ohio River, after crossing Kentucky Highway 8. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed of the tornado was estimated to be 160 miles per hour in Campbell County and 140 miles per hour in Pendleton County. The tornado traveled a total of 2.68 miles in Campbell County, and 4 miles in Pendleton County. The tornado then moved into Clermont County Ohio at 1646 EST, where it hit the town of Moscow, causing EF3 damage. The tornado continued on the ground across Clermont County, crossing into Brown County at 1658 EST. The tornado then lifted south of Hamersville in western Brown County at 1702 EST. This tornado caused extensive damage to structures and trees along its entire path on both sides of the Ohio River. Numerous homes were very heavily damaged or destroyed. Many homes lost their roofs, having complete exterior wall failure. Some modular homes were completely removed from their foundations, lifted, and thrown in excess of 100 yards where they were destroyed. The damage in Ohio from this tornado was consistent with maximum winds estimated at 160 miles per hour in Clermont County, and 100 miles per hour in Brown County.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the afternoon and evening hours of March 2nd, 2012, an historic tornado outbreak occurred in eastern Kentucky. Tornadoes struck Menifee, Morgan, Bath, Wolfe, Laurel, Johnson and Martin Counties causing a combined 16 deaths in those counties. The hardest hit areas were West Liberty in Morgan county, Salyersville in Magoffin county, and East Bernstadt in Laurel county. One of the strongest tornadoes in this outbreak, rated at EF-3 with winds estimated at 140 mph, caused extensive damage in Menifee and Morgan counties. This tornado killed 2 people in Menifee county and took an additional 6 lives in Morgan county. The town of West Liberty was particularly hard hit, with every building in the downtown area suffering some degree of damage. Several homes were swept off their foundations. ||A second EF-3 tornado touched down in extreme southeast Wolfe County and cut a path of damage across portions of Magoffin, Johnson, and Martin Counties. This twister was at its most intense strength in Magoffin and Johnson Counties, with winds estimated at 160 mph. This tornado caused catastrophic damage in parts of Salyersville. This second tornado killed 2 people in Johnson County. ||A third strong tornado caused extensive damage in and near the community of East Bernstadt in Laurel County. This tornado was rated at EF-2 and caused 6 fatalities. Most of these deaths occurred when several trailer homes were picked up and destroyed by the tornado. ||An EF-1 tornado was also confirmed in Bath County. This tornado caused extensive damage to trees, farm buildings and residences along its track. Fortunately, no deaths or injuries occurred as a result of this tornado. ||The storms that occurred on March 2nd also produced very large hail. Reports were received of hailstones as big as baseballs. Extensive damage to trees and structures due to thunderstorm wind gusts also occurred. To top it all off, the heavy rain produced by the large and powerful thunderstorms lead to flash flooding in several counties where tornadoes also occurred.",

During the early afternoon, a cluster of low-topped storms developed east of Bowling Green and moved north towards Louisville. This convection, which was barely deep enough to produce any lightning, became surface-based as slightly unstable conditions developed within a clear slot that rotated across the Lower Ohio Valley in the wake of early morning showers. A couple of these cells developed into mini-supercells with rotation. Two weak tornadoes touched down in and just east of the Louisville metro area.

During the early afternoon, a cluster of low-topped storms developed east of Bowling Green and moved north towards Louisville. This convection, which was barely deep enough to produce any lightning, became surface-based as slightly unstable conditions developed within a clear slot that rotated across the Lower Ohio Valley in the wake of early morning showers. A couple of these cells developed into mini-supercells with rotation. Two weak tornadoes touched down in and just east of the Louisville metro area.  Additional thunderstorms with large hail developed later that evening ahead of a final disturbance rotating around the south side of the upper low.",

This line, fueled by unseasonably mild temperatures near 70 degrees, dewpoints around 60, and an intense low level jet of 80kt at 850mb, spawned one of the largest January tornadic outbreaks on record across the Lower Ohio Valley. This line entered west central Kentucky around 2 am January 30th, exiting the Bluegrass and Lake Cumberland Regions during the pre-dawn hours. Several circulations along the squall line produced tornadoes. In addition, strong synoptic southerly winds right ahead and along this line produced localized wind damage.",

On the northeast section of this segment, a reflectivity notch became apparent.  A circulation developed and quickly spawned an EF-2 tornado across northern LaRue County. ||The tornado touched down near the Hardin-LaRue county line between Routes 210 and 61 just northeast of Tonieville.  On Castleman Road, just northeast of the Castleman-Carter Brother's Road intersection, a metal shop had its metal sheeting roof removed and thrown downwind around 100 yards.  Its garage door was bent and insulation was scattered about.  Several trees were uprooted near this location. Damage was estimated as EF-1. ||Downstream, on Carter Brother's Road, a large RV was blown on its side within a mostly destroyed shed.  A two story pole tobacco barn was destroyed.  Many Red and White Oak trees were either sheared off or had lost many large limbs.  Across the road a metal livestock building was destroyed with chaotic damage around a house. Winds here were estimated at around 115 mph, or EF-2.|       |Along State Road 1607, not far from the intersection of Salem Church and Dan Dunn Roads, a silo was caved in and a portion of a corn field flattened.  ||Considerable damage was surveyed along portions of Slack Road.  A one-room schoolhouse was destroyed.  A dairy farm had several buildings destroyed, along with many trees uprooted.  Based on damage to this dairy farm, tornadic winds up to 130 mph were estimated, near the high end of the EF-2 scale.  Also along Slack Road, a two-story house has its entire roof removed.  Blown-in insulation was caked on the entire side of a house.  A shed was destroyed along with a few trees.  The tornado lifted around one fifth of a mile northeast of Nuff Cemetery, near the intersection of Trumbull and Roanoke Roads.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Multiple rounds of convection developed on June 26th across southern Indiana, sliding southeast into north central Kentucky.  In all, three episodes of heavy thunderstorms contributed to localized flash flooding across north central Kentucky, including Louisville, Lexington, and in Madison County.  The last two episodes, arriving during the late-afternoon and late-evening hours, brought wind damage, flooding and one long-tracked strong tornado in LaRue County.  At the beginning of the day, Kentucky lay in a very humid airmass, with dewpoints in the lower 70s. During the pre-dawn hours, the remains of a decaying nocturnal mesoscale convective system brought widespread substantial rains to Louisville and areas eastward along and north of Interstate 64 towards Frankfort.  Some areas in metropolitan Louisville received over 1 inch of rain.  This convective system didn't penetrate very far into Kentucky before dissipating, leaving an undisturbed airmass for later in the afternoon.  A second wave of storms moved southeast across the same area during the mid-afternoon hours. These were surface-based and brought localized flash flooding and wind damage. The final round of storms moved southeast of the Ohio River near and southwest of Louisville around mid-evening, supported by a strong digging shortwave moving southeast across Illinois.  This final round of storms brought additional flash flooding, damaging winds, and a tornado.",

The most intense damage in McCracken County was rated EF-2 at a uranium enrichment plant just west of Grahamville. At that location, three metal roll-up doors on the main processing building were blown in. Some wall panels on the large processing building were blown out. The tops of three steel power transmission towers within the plant grounds were bent over. A few power lines were snapped. Cooling tower shrouds were blown off. Some siding on a cooling tower was damaged. One sport utility vehicle was shoved 30 yards into a ditch. An off-duty employee of the plant was seriously injured when tornado debris, including another car, was blown into his vehicle. Elsewhere in the county, an abandoned mobile home was demolished, though the undercarriage remained. Many houses had damage to shingles and siding. Some metal roofs were slightly damaged. A wooden fence was ripped from the ground. Chain link fences were blown over. Trees were uprooted or snapped off, some striking homes. A church foyer was destroyed. Road signs were bent. The average path width was 100 yards in McCracken County. The tornado continued east across the Ohio River into Massac County, Illinois, where it strengthened to EF-3 intensity. The total path length of this tornado was 42 miles. The parent supercell tracked from southeast Missouri across the Mississippi River through the Paducah area, then east to the Kentucky Lake area of western Kentucky.",

Low level wind shear was very strong, with 0 to 1 km bulk shear near 50 knots. This shear was present amidst decent instability for late fall, with mixed-layer capes of 500 to 1000 j/kg. One supercell cluster moved east from the Paducah area along the Western Kentucky Parkway. The other supercell cluster moved east across the far northwest counties of Kentucky, passing south of Evansville and then across the Owensboro area. The storms initiated over Missouri along a pre-frontal low pressure trough, then moved east across the Lower Ohio Valley. Strong southerly surface winds ahead of the storms gusted up to 50 mph during the early morning hours. An off-duty meteorologist measured a gust to 50 mph in Calvert City in Marshall County.",

An unseasonal combination of temperatures in the lower 70s with lower 60s dewpoints overspread all of Illinois,  Indiana, and Kentucky during the early afternoon. A strong jet aloft and very high helicities lead to one of the worst November tornado outbreaks ever, with several dozen tornadoes noted over Illinois and Indiana. However, across much of Kentucky and southern Indiana, widespread cloudiness held temperatures in the mid 60s and severely limited surface-based instability during the afternoon.||In west central Kentucky, a broken line of storms developed. Some of these developed persistent rotation and brought several tornadoes to the western portion of the state. One circulation moved into Butler County, and eventually produced an EF-1 tornado across the central portion of the county. ||Across northern Kentucky, along the Ohio River, widespread soaking rains developed during the pre-dawn hours and continued through mid-morning. Heavy tropical showers trained over a strip of counties right along the Ohio River, including Jefferson, Meade, and Oldham Counties. Some locations received locally over 3 inches of rain in a 5 hour period. Some minor urban flooding inconvenienced several motorists.",

A strong, negatively tilted shortwave at 500 mb ejected northeast from the southern Plains, providing strong forcing for ascent. A squall line organized near the Mississippi River and then surged east-northeast in association with the strengthening surface low. Unseasonably warm and moist air advanced across western Kentucky and southwest Indiana ahead of the squall line. Though instability was weak, it was based near the ground. Very strong low-level wind shear supported embedded circulations within the squall line. These resulted in pockets of very damaging winds and an isolated tornado.",

One church received light to moderate damage. A small portion of the church's metal roof was blown off, and the steeple came down. A nearby small, wooden barn was heavily damaged. There was nearby tree damage. Otherwise, all the known damage occurred in the Tennessee portion of the track. The damage occurred in the vicinity of the intersection of Highways 781 and 166 west of Fulton. Peak winds in the Fulton County portion of the track were near 90 mph.",

A mid-level disturbance supported the development of storms in a region where sunshine heated and destabilized the atmosphere ahead of a cold front. The cold front was approaching the Mississippi River as the storms developed. The storms intensified as a low-level jet supported an influx of warmer and moister air.

A mile farther to the northeast, just before lifting, the tornado sheared off a portion of a row of trees adjacent to Maraman Road.

Shortly after dawn, a line of thunderstorms began to train along a thin strip over  Hancock County, Kentucky, and extending northwards into southern Indiana. Three to as much as 4 inches of rain fell within a 2 hour period, leading to flash flooding. Later in the day, modest instability developed across the Bluegrass Region and east central Kentucky.

A section of roofing and the associated supporting structure measuring approximately 75 by 75 feet was destroyed and deposited immediately to the southwest of the original location. The entire dock measured approximately 100 by 225 feet and was attached to a number of metal poles anchored into the lake bottom. These poles were approximately 6 inches in diameter and were all bent at least several degrees toward the southwest, indicating the entire structure was moved in that direction. This movement was perpendicular to the apparent storm motion at that time as ascertained from radar.||Tree damage was also observed on an island approximately 150 yards east of this dock. Several 4 to 8 inch diameter trees had fallen toward the northwest. Additional trees of similar size were also noted to be downed along the western shore of the lake near Knox Lillard Road, approximately a half mile southeast of the intersection with US Route 42. Roof covering and several concrete cinder blocks securing a patio roof were lifted from a structure along the shoreline. This material was deposited 50 to 100 feet south of the original location.||The tornado ended just before Hillandale Drive where some minor tree damage occurred along the shoreline.",

A consistent path up to a half mile wide of uprooted and snapped hardwood and softwood trees was observed descending down the Upper Double branch creek, crossing Highway 2009 and then ascending back up the adjacent hillside in a west-northwest to east-southeast direction. Uprooted trees damaged a cemetery but no habitable structures were damaged. Based on visible damage, maximum winds likely reached 110 mph in the tornado. The tornado touched down in a remote area and the only access was via Highway 2009, thus tornado specifics are limited to what could be observed from the road and information obtained from a local land owner.",

Isolated storms moved across the area during the late morning hours as they moved out of Indiana and Ohio. The more significant severe weather episode occurred during the afternoon and evening hours south of the Mountain Parkway. The second round of storms began to form as warm moist air off the Gulf of Mexico moved northward and interacted with a frontal boundary that extended from south central Indiana into central Kentucky. Numerous reports of large hail between quarter and softball size were received by the weather office. The storms also blew down large numbers of trees across the area. The hardest areas were Clay, Leslie, McCreary, and Whitley counties, where numerous reports of downed trees, giant hail and even one tornado were received.

Disturbances rotating around this feature brought several rounds of convection from late morning through the evening hours. Low freezing levels and veering and strengthening winds with height provided the ingredients for rotating storms and very large hail.  During the late morning hours, a severe convective line segment exhibiting areas of rotation moved southeast across southern Indiana, crossed the Ohio River just north of Louisville, and moved across the northern Bluegrass Region north of Frankfort and Lexington. This fast moving line of storms brought widespread wind damage and large hail to Clark County, Indiana and along its path across the northern Bluegrass. Rotation increased within this storm complex when it was north of Lexington, when it spawned a family of relatively weak tornadoes.  This initial round of storms left behind a stationary boundary. By mid afternoon, a whole series of rotating supercells developed along this boundary, each of then tracking essentially along the same path from southern Indiana into Oldham County and across the northern Bluegrass.  These individual storms each produced large hail and occasional funnel clouds.",

More tree damage was found along Paynes Run Road, in addition to an outbuilding that was destroyed with debris lofted into an adjacent valley. Where Paynes Run Road intersects with New Columbus Road, several homes sustained minor roof damage with windows blown out, as well as significant tree damage. The tornado continued along New Columbus Road where a porch was lifted from a home (its final resting place still is unknown) and roof damage occurred to the home itself. From here the tornado damage became intermittent along the south side of New Columbus Road and Dudley Pike, with instances of tree damage, outbuildings destroyed and minor roof damage to several homes. The last instances of tornado damage in Owen County were found along portions of Leaning Oak Road where damage consisted of peeled back roofing material on barns, many trees snapped or uprooted and roof damage to homes. ||According to the survey from NWS Louisville, the storm quickly crossed into Scott County and struck North Rays Fork Road where it snapped and uprooted trees. Moving to the east-southeast, tree damage was found along South Rays Fork Road east of Stonewall. The tornado lifted just west of the Harrison County line. The only structural damage along the path was to a home near the top of a small hill close to the end of the path. The porch roof was ripped from the home and thrown over the building, with significant roof damage. Also, an above ground pool was destroyed. The damage in Scott County supports an estimated maximum wind speed of 107 mph (EF1).",

Three confirmed tornadoes occurred in Bath and Pike counties (2 in Bath and 1 in Pike). These twisters caused varying degrees of damage to trees, power lines, and various structures in both counties. These tornadoes were small and extremely short lived, which made them quite difficult to detect on radar. Numerous reports of large hail and wind damage were also received during this event. Some minor flooding occurred where numerous thunderstorms tracked across the same areas. The storms formed in a warm and only slightly unstable air mass that had set up across central and eastern Kentucky. The primary trigger for the severe and tornadic storms was a very strong and dynamic middle and upper level wind field that was present over the region. The rapid change in wind speed with height caused most every thunderstorm that formed on this day to rotate. A few of these circulations were able to reach the surface in Bath and Pike counties where the tornadoes were reported.",

Ahead of it, a strong warm front sharpened across southern Indiana and central Kentucky.  South of the front, sunshine broke out and helped temperatures surge into the 80s, while north of the front temperatures were only in the 50s. At one point, there was a 40 degree temperature difference across the state of Kentucky from north to south!  This strong front helped to focus severe thunderstorm development in the late afternoon and evening hours.  Many of the storms that formed were supercells, which dropped very large hail. Two of these supercells developed weak tornadoes during the evening hours.",

This rain-wrapped tornado was only on the ground for about minute, with most of its damage limited to large limbs and weaker tree trunks being snapped.  The tornado started along Belmont Rd (KY Highway 251) 0.7 miles west of Belmont, then traveled east-northeast through the community of Belmont, and lifting just east of Church Street. At least three homes were damaged, two from trees falling on them, with minor roofing damage to a third.  Trees also fell on at least two out buildings. The storm that spawned this tornado was the same one that produced an EF-0 moments earlier 11 miles to the west.",

This location is south of Butler and northwest of Falmouth in Pendleton County. A mobile home originally anchored into the ground at 8-10 points was tilted and briefly lifted before rolling onto its top on the east side of Bethel Loop. The three residents sustained minor injuries requiring overnight hospitalization. Debris from the mobile home was carried downwind for approximately one-tenth of a mile. The debris field remained confined to a narrow path as it tapered to the east-northeast. This seemed indicative of convergent motion associated with the circulation. There were also several 6-8 inch trees snapped immediately west of the mobile home. This is likely where the first touchdown occurred. The tornado then lifted. The next damage location was a metal barn on Ashcraft Road. The entire roof was lifted and removed from the barn. The roof measured approximately 60 feet by 30 feet and the barn was relatively new (construction within the last 10 years). The roof was carried into adjacent trees immediately northeast of the structure. There was minor damage to a smaller barn just northwest of the path center line. The homeowner also described a dock approximately 15 square feet that was pulled from its anchor and moved north-northeast across a pond toward the center line of the path. All of this damage indicated a convergent and lifting motion associated with the tornado. The tornado then lifted again, as damage was next observed along Route 609 just south of the intersection with Davis Road. One barn west of Route 609 was destroyed and a tree approximately 20 inches in diameter immediately east of the road was snapped at the trunk and fell against a residence. Debris was carried between one and two tenths of a mile to the northeast. Another barn just to the north was partially destroyed. Tornadic damage was not as conclusive at this location, but debris was confined to a narrow path likely due to convergent wind motion. A number of trees were snapped to the northeast along Davis Road. Trees ranged in diameter from 8 to 16 inches. The clearest evidence of circulation on the ground was located along Route 159 where several types of damage occurred at a residence south of the intersection with Davis Road. The roof was partially removed from the residence and some of the insulation was dispersed to the west and spattered against the west side of the house. Insulation was also spattered on trees immediately to the northwest. Heavy sections of metal fencing from a horse corral were lifted and carried approximately 50 yards to the west. Both of these debris fields were carried and deposited opposite the storm motion. A number of trees just north and south of the residence were also snapped. The tornado lifted again before touching down one last time. The final damage was found along Hickory Grove Road, south of the intersection with Route 10.

A car dealership on U.S. Highway 45 right near the city limit received extensive damage, including the loss of almost all 40 vehicles on the lot as well as a nearby storage building. The peak wind speed of 140 mph was assigned at this car lot. A flea market type of business on Highway 121 just outside Mayfield was destroyed by winds near 135 mph. Once the tornado reached the northern edge of Mayfield, it tracked almost parallel to the Purchase Parkway (future Interstate 69). The center of the tornado stayed about one-half mile north of the parkway, crossing Kentucky Highways 131 and 301 prior to reaching the Marshall County line.

The initial round of thunderstorms occurred early in the afternoon over northwest Kentucky. These storms, which produced a major hailstorm and flash flood in the Owensboro area, were triggered by a weak upper-level low over northern Illinois. This initial round of thunderstorms produced an outflow of cooler air that settled south into southwest Kentucky. By mid-afternoon, isolated supercells with tornadoes fired up along the leading edge of cooler air. Strong westerly upper-level winds associated with the upper-level low over Illinois provided ample wind shear for supercells. A southwest wind flow of moist and unstable air in the lower levels of the atmosphere provided fuel for the storms. Low-level winds up to around 40 knots enhanced low-level wind shear, providing a favorable environment for tornadoes. The supercells lingered well into the evening.",

This initial round of thunderstorms produced an outflow of cooler air that settled south into southwest Kentucky. By mid-afternoon, isolated supercells with tornadoes fired up along the leading edge of cooler air. Strong westerly upper-level winds associated with the upper-level low over Illinois provided ample wind shear for supercells. A southwest wind flow of moist and unstable air in the lower levels of the atmosphere provided fuel for the storms. Low-level winds up to around 40 knots enhanced low-level wind shear, providing a favorable environment for tornadoes. The supercells lingered well into the evening.",

The tornado was only on the ground for approximately 200 yards with a path width about 30-40 yards. A basement crawlspace door was blown out along with siding and roof damage at 125 Spinks Dr. There was evidence of isolated straight-line winds with some maple trees on Hamlin Chapel Dr. The tornado touched down for a second time at 41 El Retiro Ln where the path width increased to 50 yards and the winds speed increased to 90-95 mph. Numerous large hardwood trees were snapped and twisted. An outbuilding, previously used to make brooms, next to the house had significant damage when a large tree fell on top of it. The residents observed pea size hail.  ||The tornado increased in size at 532 Stoneridge Ln. A custom-built home had exterior wall damage in the master bedroom with adjacent bathroom. Their insulation blew out in all directions in the house and the back porch resembled a snow globe. Numerous trees were down along the property as well as a grain silo. The family survived the tornado by sheltering in a 3-foot crawlspace and when they came out, there was quarter-sized hail on the ground. Winds in this area were 110 mph with a path width about 125 yards.||The tornado continued to move east northeast along the countryside uprooting twisting and damaging numerous hardwood trees. The tornado significantly increased in width to approximately 300 yards and did a lot of damage along Halls Creek Rd. At 1130 Halls Creed Road 2-inch hail occurred before the EF-2 tornado, with winds of 111 mph, did significant damage to the property, which included a 30x50 large barn sliding the wall 12 feet.||Along Walnut Rd, the tornado caused damage to several barns and numerous softwood trees and hardwood trees. Metal sheeting from barns was thrown in excess of 400 yards downwind.||At the intersection of Highway 1164 and 1544 at the Cedar Grove Church there was roof damage to the church and many trees were twisted and uprooted. The last visible damage was along Highway 1544 just east of 1164 with some trees uprooted and twisted. About 30 feet from the tree there was an outbuilding that had half its roof blown off and the roof remnants were found about 50 yards away. The tornado lifted approximately 400 yards from Highway 1544 near the intersection of 1164.",

The initial round of thunderstorms occurred early in the afternoon over northwest Kentucky. These storms, which produced a major hailstorm and flash flood in the Owensboro area, were triggered by a weak upper-level low over northern Illinois. This initial round of thunderstorms produced an outflow of cooler air that settled south into southwest Kentucky. By mid-afternoon, isolated supercells with tornadoes fired up along the leading edge of cooler air. Strong westerly upper-level winds associated with the upper-level low over Illinois provided ample wind shear for supercells. A southwest wind flow of moist and unstable air in the lower levels of the atmosphere provided fuel for the storms. Low-level winds up to around 40 knots enhanced low-level wind shear, providing a favorable environment for tornadoes. The supercells lingered well into the evening.",

A couple of the storms increased in intensity, showing occasional supercell characteristics.  One such storm produced a weak tornado as it crossed northern Marshall County.

A southwesterly low-level jet increased substantially during the evening. A couple of tornadoes were produced in southwest Kentucky, along with a few reports of hail and damaging wind. Outside of the thunderstorm activity, some of the southwest winds aloft mixed down to the surface in the form of gusts from 40 to 50 mph, and an isolated gradient wind gust to 65 mph was measured on a hill near Calvert City in Marshall County.",

The most significant damage occurred on Jones Ln where 100 mph winds completely destroyed a couple of large barns, along with other small outbuildings. In addition, a large grain bin was demolished, and an anchored mobile home was pushed off its foundation on the north side of the damage path. A large debris field was scattered 200-300 yards downwind. East of I-71, the tornado damaged more outbuildings, and snapped trees. After destroying another older barn, the tornado ended just east of Highway 55 where numerous softwood trees were snapped and uprooted. Very strong convergence was noted in the damage. Also of note, were several instances of straight line wind damage feeding into the main circulation from the south. These wind speeds were estimated at 70-80 mph.

Several grain bins were destroyed, including a grain bin that was blown over or through a row of trees and across Highway 94. Peak winds were estimated near 110 mph on the Kentucky side of the track. The tornado ended shortly after crossing Kentucky Highway 94 about 2.5 miles west of Hickman. There was scattered tree damage associated with straight-line winds south of the tornado track, likely associated with the rear-flank downdraft. A trained spotter measured a wind gust to 85 mph 5 to 10 miles west of Hickman.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "An outbreak of severe thunderstorms occurred over the Tennessee border counties. Thunderstorms rapidly developed across western Kentucky ahead of a line of thunderstorms over the Missouri Bootheel region. These initial storms formed along a southwesterly low-level jet and its associated moisture plume. Large hail was the primary severe weather hazard in this leading activity, which was elevated above the surface. Later in the evening, a surface-based bowing line of thunderstorms exited southeast Missouri and then crossed southwest Kentucky. This bowing line was associated with an embedded supercell that spawned a few tornadoes. The storms developed along and just ahead of a cold front as it pressed southward into the Lower Ohio Valley and extreme southeast Missouri.",

In the center of Hickman, the tornado caused significant damage to the county's jail and 911 communications center, which lost parts of the roof and a section of a wall. About 100 inmates were moved to other facilities. Other damage in Hickman included a heavily damaged gas station, numerous downed signs and power poles, and considerable roof damage to a few homes. The tornado damaged or destroyed more than 45 homes and other buildings in the county, as well as several machine sheds, barns, grain bins, and irrigation systems. At least 20 power poles were broken, and numerous trees were uprooted and snapped. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet Fulton County Highway Maintenance Facility was hit by the tornado. The salt dome, a tractor shed, and several tractors housed in the shed were damaged. The tornado reached its peak intensity just southeast of Hickman along Highway 125, where a frame house had its entire roof structure blown off. The tornado followed Highway 125 from the center of Hickman to the junction of Highway 166, about 4.5 miles southeast of Hickman. Most state highways were closed in and near Hickman, and the Red Cross opened a shelter. Peak winds were estimated near 125 mph. Straight-line winds up to 80 mph occurred mainly southwest of the tornado path. The tornado crossed into Tennessee along State Route 116.",

The front porch of a nearby home was briefly raised, causing the supports to fall out. The tornado moved northeast, streaming debris from the four buildings in a cyclonic pattern and into a nearby automotive repair shop that had one door blown in and another outward. The large metal shop had minor roof damage, but was pierced in several locations by debris from the outbuildings to the southwest and the entire facility was shifted slightly off its foundation. Numerous vehicles near the repair shop sustained damage when hit by large debris from the barns to the southwest. The cab of a small pickup was crushed by debris and the vehicle blown onto Highway 969. An RV parked next to the shop was blown into a utility pole. Several other vehicles had windows broken out. Metal roof panels from the destroyed buildings, along with insulation from the small home, was wrapped around trees as far as a half mile from their origin, with other small debris observed as far as 3/4 mile from the initial touchdown location.",

One home lost about a third of its roof, and another home had the back porch blown off. Several smaller outbuildings or garages were destroyed. A large chicken house lost one-quarter of its roof. Kentucky Highway 307 was closed by downed trees and power lines north of Highway 58. Hundreds of trees and tree limbs were blown down. Four eyewitnesses reported seeing the tornado near Fulgham. Most of the damage was concentrated around and just north of Fulgham. The tornado weakened somewhat as it crossed into Graves County, and the damage track became more intermittent there.

The tornado touched down on the edge of a large wooded area west of Highway 527 0.4 miles south of St Francis. Moving due east, it snapped the trunks of several large trees, blocking the highway, and mowed down a line of trees along Louis Mattingly Road. It continued to to tree-top damage in a heavily wooded area as it moved east, then tore roof panels off several hog barns on the south end of A. Mills Road. Drone footage of corn near the barns showed multiple streaks of converging winds in an area approximately 100 yards in width. Continuing to east-southeast, the tornado left downed numerous more trees in a cyclonic pattern on both sides of Spencer-Hamilton Road south of Loretto. Strong inflow and outflow winds estimated at 60-80 mph damaged several outbuildings and downed other trees south of the tornado along Spencer-Hamilton Road as the tornado dissipated. The Louisville NWS office thanks John Humphress and Tanner Thompson for the drone imagery that helped pinpoint the path of this rural tornado.",

The damage moved in from Robertson County Tennessee near the end of McGee Road where two homes received extensive damage. The first home, a well built stone home had significant roof damage and the screened in porch was destroyed. The family pick up truck was tossed around 40 yards to the north. On the family cemetery plot several tombstones were knocked over and one headstone was destroyed. There were several outbuildings and 2 pole Barnes were destroyed on the property as well. ||The second home experienced significant foundation damage and the roof was completely thrown off. The family pick up truck was thrown 250 yards and thrown down into a field. Insulation from the home was thrown down wind over 300 yards. The debris field from the two homes was thrown in a farmers field between 100 yards in a quarter mile down wind with several 2 x 4 and 2 x 10 and bricks being impaled into the ground.  Winds were estimated between 120 and 130 mph. ||The tornado then moved through several farmers fields doing extensive tree damage and fence damage. Power lines were down throughout this entire stretch.| |The tornado then hit 901 Dot Road destroying 2 barns, moving heavy farm equipment, blowing out exterior walls and destroying the roof at the property. Tragically, a woman in the home was killed by falling debris.  The family pet dog was found alive by rescuers underneath extensive rubble.  Debris was thrown up to 500 yards and debris with a width of between 250 and and 300 yards in a farmers field.  Winds were estimated to be 135 mph at this location. ||Next, the tornado hit a large family farm at 3604 Schley Road destroying the second story. Three farm silos that were empty or destroyed with the metal sheets being thrown over a quarter mile down wind. The tornado continued through farm fields destroying several trees and uprooting them.||The tornado became more elevated at the intersection of Mortimor Station Road and Mirriaheh Road.  In this area trees we snapped, and several homes experienced shingle siding and roof damage. Winds were estimated to be 100 to 110 mph here. ||As the tornado was lifting, it snapped some trees in the Schochoh community.",

The very narrow tornado - only 30 to 50 yards wide - continued northeast, uprooting trees and damaging outbuildings on neighboring property, including breaking out all of the windows of one building. The path continued northeast over open countryside, snapping tree limbs of several trees. It then tore the porch off the east side of a home on the south side of Highway 68-80, depositing debris into nearby woods. ||Crossing 68-80, the tornado did its greatest damage, tearing a very large pine tree out of the ground and tossing it 100 feet over a home, spattering the front of the home with mud, ripping holes in the roof, and destroying the attached garage. Despite this intense damage, an open-sided outbuilding just 25 yards away suffered no visible damage. Continuing northeast, the tornado snapped several more trees before destroying two more outbuildings, scattering debris a quarter of a mile downwind. The tornado also damaged the roof of a home 100 feet east of the outbuildings, and did porch, deck, and roof damage to the neighboring residence, plastering the east side of the home with insulation. Crossing over Lewis Rd into Barren County, the roof of a sunroom was torn of the next home and an outbuilding destroyed. The tornado then moved over open countryside where drone footage showed it deposited the remainder of its debris. The total path length of the tornado in both counties was 1.9 miles.",

Debris from the barn damaged a nearby house and was embedded into a small trailer over 100 yards away. Some debris was buried up to three feet deep. Another outbuilding was destroyed. As the tornado crossed Highway 999, it damaged the roofs of two homes. A garage between the two homes had windows broken, and the west side of the building was pushed out. Numerous trees were snapped and uprooted along the path of the tornado. There was an eyewitness account of the tornado. Peak winds were estimated near 100 mph.",

North of that line, serious flash flooding resulted in a fatality. A surface low pressure center tracked rapidly north-northeast from Arkansas to the upper Mississippi Valley, dragging a warm front north across western Kentucky.

A very moist air mass resulted in heavy rainfall, which produced localized flash flooding due to the water-logged ground. Locally 5 to 6 inches of rain had fallen over the previous week.

            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "An outbreak of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes occurred across western Kentucky. Most of the severe weather was along and south of a Paducah to Madisonville line. North of that line, serious flash flooding resulted in a fatality. A surface low pressure center tracked rapidly north-northeast from Arkansas to the upper Mississippi Valley, dragging a warm front north across western Kentucky. Instability was adequate for tornadoes and severe storms in the presence of very strong wind shear. A very moist air mass resulted in heavy rainfall, which produced localized flash flooding due to the water-logged ground. Locally 5 to 6 inches of rain had fallen over the previous week. Rainfall rates in these thunderstorms were locally one-half to one inch per hour.",

One piece of roofing lumber was |found 500 feet ENE of the home. A second |building, a large 2-story brick industrial |building 1/2 mile east - had about 20 |percent of its metal roof peeled off. |Immediately after hitting this building |and downing trees in a nearby cemetery, |it crossed U.S. Hwy 62 and did additional |tree damage for another several hundred |feet as it moved through a wooded area. |The National Weather Service thanks Ohio |County Emergency Management for their |assistance in this survey, including |drone surveillance that helped |identify the path of this storm.",

Intermittent tree top damage continued near Lake Louisvilla. At Westport Business  Center there was significant roof damage with portions of the roofing material and parts of the roof supports 20 to 50 yards downwind and several windows blown out. At Ceva Logistics a large section of the north wall was pushed out due to 75-80 mph winds.||The tornado struck the north portion of Westport Bend Commerce Park, snapping and bending several trees.

Moving northeast over forested land, the next evidence was more tree trunks and branches snapped on Poplar Grove Rd just north of the intersection with Hilldale Rd. The tornado then continued to skip northeast, snapping branches and trunks to the west of Frank Luttrell Rd, before crossing the road and causing minor roof damage to the metal roof of a barn and snapping more tree limbs a third of a mile southeast of North Hancock Elementary School. The tornado dropped small branches and leaves along its path as it continued northeast. The last major tree damage was observed around a home on Adair Rd, where trees were uprooted and trunks snapped in a cyclonic pattern around the home. The only damage to the home, however, was minor roof damage from a branch falling on it. The storm then crossed Adair Rd, lifting somewhere in a wooded area west of a large pond near Beauchamp Lane, where residents witnessed its dissipation.",

It carried copious amounts of moisture as it continued to rotate while slowly moving north.  In Kentucky, the outer bands of the system brought showers and thunderstorms that produced isolated wind damage September 5 and 6.   By September 8th, Gordon was centered in southeast Missouri with much of its moisture and energy in the Ohio River Valley interacted with a stationary front. This produced efficient rainfall that caused flash flooding, and the environmental shear was strong enough to produce two tornadoes along the Ohio River in southern Indiana and north-central Kentucky.",

It did minor roof damage to two homes, tossed a trampoline into a neighboring home, causing siding damage, and pushed a large travel trailer onto a minivan, heavily damaging both. Mud was spattered onto the north-facing front of the home, where a porch column support was also moved slightly.  From here it traveled east-northeast, snapping tree limbs as it skipped over mainly open pastureland until it reached Thomas Rd. ||On the west side of Thomas Road, the tornado reached its greatest intensities and size, with winds of 100 mph and a path width of 80 yards. Here it damaged four outbuildings, completely destroying two - the largest being a 30 x 50 structure. The debris pattern from the four outbuildings and nearby trees with snapped trunks and limbs showed clear cyclonic rotation. Metal roofing and siding material was scattered nearly a quarter of a mile to the east- northeast, with some of it lofted into the trees of a heavily wooded area. Other building debris from the largest structure was blown to the northwest, and the south and east-facing walls of a number of structures were spattered with leaves and other ground-based vegetation. Three east-facing garage doors of one of the outbuildings were blown in, and damage sustained to the vehicles in the driveway from downed tree limbs. Three homes in the area sustained roof and siding damage, including a 2x4 from one of the outbuildings blown through an exterior wall. ||The tornado became elevated as it continued east-northeast from Thomas Rd, snapping a few tree limbs in a wooded area before briefly touching down one last time on Rineyville Rd, where it littered the highway with tree limbs and tore the front porch off a home, vaulting the roof over the house into the back yard. Security cameras from a business next door captured the damage occurring as a wall of wind and water that occurred in less than half a minute. No further damage occurred to the east of this location as the tornado dissipated. NWS was assisted in the storm survey by Hardin County Emergency Management.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "Large scale lift and moisture transport were in place beneath the right entrance region of an upper level jet situated between a central U.S. trough and an Atlantic Coast ridge.  A former tropical low coupled with and rode the upper level flow northeast along a cold front that was draped across the middle and lower Mississippi River Valley. This strengthened a surface wave that moved through the Ohio River Valley region that caused a response in the low level jet, resulting in an increase in precipitation coverage and intensity. The intensified storms produced areas of gusty winds and a single tornado in Hardin County, Kentucky.",

Moving eastward over open fields, it tore most of the roof off a barn at the end of Doug White Road, plastering insulation from the barn onto the northeast side of the adjacent home. To the north of the barn and home, it tossed a 1500 lb. hay roll southeast over a fence. From here, the tornado raced east-northeast over more fields, where it snapped the tops off a few trees before it hit the next farm, at Milky Way Lane on Mt. Carmel Road. Here it destroyed one large outbuilding and tore much of the roof off another in addition to destroying two small grain hoppers. Flying debris damaged at least two other buildings and vehicles, with roofing debris scattered a quarter of a mile to the northeast. Across the road from these buildings, the tornado tore the roof off and partially collapsed the wall of another large outbuilding. Flying debris from this building damaged another outbuilding, while columns on the southwest-facing front porch of the farm home were blown out as the porch roof was briefly elevated.||The tornado continued eastward, snapping the trunks of several large trees along Butler Creek and damaging carports and a metal outbuilding along Holmes Bend Rd and Turkey Trace. Again moving over open land, the final two buildings damaged were metal outbuildings on Willis Rd and near the intersection of West Egypt Rd and Knifley Rd. It also toppled the sign of the Green River Bait and Grocery before lifting as it crossed Knifley Rd.",

Other than mud spattering from the south-southwest on the back corner of the brick one-story home, no other evidence of wind was observed, as no shingles were damaged.||The tornado immediately lifted over the home and nearby trees, then passed over a wooded area and open farmland, setting back down in a subdivision on the west side of New Calvary Road, about a mile east.  Several small tree trunks were snapped in the subdivision, but no visible structural damage occurred. The tiny twister then continued to the northeast, causing other minor tree damage to the south of Probus Lane.  The last tree damage was observed near a small pond near the end of Probus Lane.

The tornado track passed just northwest and north of the community of Lovelaceville. The two primary structural damage areas were the crossing points along Highway 1837 west of Lovelaceville and Hamburg Road north of Lovelaceville. West of Lovelaceville on Highway 1837, there was major roof damage to a few structures, including a mobile home and a farm outbuilding. A well-defined path of broken and uprooted trees was also evident. As the tornado reached Hamburg Road, the first evidence of EF-2 damage became visible. A large portion of the exterior wall of a house collapsed, and there was significant roof damage to the house. A nearby farm outbuilding was demolished. A swath of snapped and uprooted trees crossed the area. Building debris was deposited well downwind of the damaged or destroyed structures. Four cows were killed. The tornado path widened quickly, reaching 300 yards shortly after exiting Carlisle County.  Peak winds in Ballard County were estimated near 115 mph. The tornado then crossed into McCracken County, where the majority of the damage path was located.",

            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "This multi-county tornado entered McCracken County from Ballard County near the community of Lovelaceville. The tornado tracked within a couple of miles either side of U.S. Highway 62 for most of its path in McCracken County. The tornado intermittently reached EF-2 intensity from the Ballard County line to about two miles southeast of Barkley Regional Airport. A total of 25 dwellings were damaged along the path in McCracken County. Five businesses were damaged, and 20 residences were damaged. The damage was categorized as minor for 14 of the residences, major for one, and five were destroyed. Major structural damage included partial loss of roofs or walls. Minor damage to homes included the loss of shingles. Dozens of barns, outbuildings, garages, or grain bins were destroyed.  A church, located on U.S. Highway 62 near Highway 305, lost much of the roof structure as well as a large part of a second story exterior wall. This is where the tornado reached its maximum intensity, with estimated peak winds near 125 mph. A total of 40 pre-schoolers were inside a day care facility in the church, but none were directly injured. At least ten vehicles sustained damage in this area near the church. The only injury occurred on U.S. Highway 62 near the church, where a grain bin was blown on top of a pickup truck traveling eastbound. During the final few miles of its track, the tornado weakened as it moved through the western part of the city of Paducah. In the western part of Paducah, the tornado moved across U.S. Highway 60 and the city's main shopping mall. The tornado dissipated shortly after crossing Interstate 24 between exits 3 and 4. The roofs of the shopping mall and a nearby strip mall were damaged. Several businesses in the mall area and along Interstate 24 sustained minor damage, mostly to roofs. Windows were blown out of vehicles and buildings. A moving semi truck was lifted along Interstate 24 and was blown into the median in a jack-knife position. Along the entire track, dozens of utility poles were down, causing extensive power outages for nearly 10,000 customers. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. Video of the tornado was captured by personnel at the Paducah National Weather Service office, which the tornado missed by about two miles.",

At the marina, two piers (which were connected to other piers as an extension) broke loose and were pushed out into the bay, dragging concrete block tie downs along the floor of the bay. These piers sustained major damage to roofs and connections between the piers. The piers which were connected to the shore were damaged, not only at the connection point between piers, but also at the connection to the shore. Electrical systems were destroyed along with gang planks between the shore and piers. There were four piers connected to the shore. The two piers that were damaged were the inside two piers, with the outside piers sustaining minor damage.",

The atmosphere ahead of the storms became strongly unstable, with surface-based capes exceeding 4,000. Given the strong buoyancy, wind profiles were sufficiently strong for widespread severe weather. Deep-layer (0-6 km) wind shear values were no higher than about 30 knots, and 0-1 km shear was about 20 knots.

            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "The National Weather Service in conjunction with Allen County EMA conducted a storm survey across the western half of Allen County. There was significant straight line wind damage across much of the county facing an easterly and southeasterly direction. Interspersed with the straight line wind damage was at least one tornado across western Allen County north of and paralleling KY 585.||The tornado touched down near the Horseshoe Ford Road and Horseshoe Bend Road intersection. There were numerous large hardwood trees split, twisted, and uprooted facing from northerly to southeasterly. Horseshoe Bend Road was closed due to trees down across the road and from flooding. Winds in this area were estimated to be between 90 and 95 mph. Further east along Mayhew Road a large, well-built barn|was uplifted and removed from its foundation with several cedar and maple trees twisted and snapped. Across a farmer's field, corn was flattened and twisted in multiple directions. Large, heavy fuel tanks were rolled in two different directions on Mayhew Road. Several barns and outbuilding had roof damage as well.||At the Mayhew and Pope Road intersection there was extensive softwood and hardwood tree damage, especially around the Harmony|Missionary Baptist Church at 5226 Pope Road. Residents said there was a major pressure change with the tornado.||There were indications there may have been more than one tornado as tree positions would go from a tornadic circulation of northeasterly to southeasterly direction and then to all straight line wind damage in an easterly wind direction, then back to a tornadic circulation in multiple directions. Radar supports this ground analysis with mesovortices along the leading edge of the potent squall line. The width of the individual circulations varied between 75 and 125 yards with widespread straight line wind damage all around.

            "EVENT_NARRATIVE": "The National Weather Service conducted a storm damage survey across southeast Allen County to assess damage from the storms on Friday Evening, June 21. There was a significant amount of straight line wind damage across southern Allen County. Most of this damage had wind speeds between 60-65 mph all facing east southeast direction. There were two significant areas of straight line wind damage. There was a barn north of Amos on Highway 99. The second was two large barns just north of Hayesville, TN. ||Interspersed among the straight line wind damage was a tornado which first touched down a half mile east of Amos. A family farm had numerous trees twisted, snapped, and uprooted. Several barns sustained severe structural damage to the roofs. A dozen or so portions of two by fours were impaled into the ground in multiple directions. ||Further southeast on Highland Church Road numerous trees were uprooted and snapped with trees facing from the north northeast to the southeast direction. There was clear evidence that the tornado went to the Tennessee state line in Macon County as we could see trees snapped and uprooted on the state line which correlates well with the NWS Nashville storm survey across the Macon County line. ||At 2592 Highland Church Road (Highland General Baptist Church) there was significant brick damage on the west, south, and east sides of the church due to open vents. The survey crew zig zagged across roads south of Scottsville to Highway 31 but only found sporadic straight line tree and barn damage all facing a southeasterly direction. ||The very last concentrated area of damage the team found was at 444 Old Buck Creek Road were there was numerous softwood tree damage at the residence with power poles down across the road.",

Although there was some minor roof damage to homes along the path, almost all of the damage was done to large, mature trees. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted (50/50). Several sheds and outbuildings were damaged. Grain bins and barns were damaged on farms in rural southwest parts of the county. On the south side of Paducah, windows were blown out of a strip mall, signage to a business was destroyed, and there was roof damage to a former church. The two main areas of significant damage were along Gum Springs Road (near Lone Oak) and in the Hendron area. A large swath of straight-line damaging winds (up to 110 mph) paralleled the track about one-half mile south from the inception of the tornado until about Interstate 24, where they merged over the Hendron area and became a single smaller path to the south side of Paducah.

The survey team found tree and agricultural building damage along the length of the path in Mason County.  The vast majority of structural damage in Mason County consisted of barns and outbuildings with roof panels removed.  The concentrated area of tree damage near the Ohio River showed clear signs of convergent damage patterns and cross-axis debris fall to the path of the circulation, confirming the likelihood of a tornadic circulation.||Across the Ohio River in the eastern side of Ripley, tree and shingle damage was found on Pearl Street, Kevin Drive, and portions of Elizabeth Street.

The tornado traveled east-northeast at 60 mph for two consecutive miles. Much of the damage path width was 100 yards or less, but peaked at 235 yards wide just east of Route 129. The tornado hit a farm/out building and did damage to several trees along Woodson Road. It intensified at Route 129, and then hit a chicken farm with substantial damage to 3 of the 6 buildings. A 4th building was moderately damaged. Two buildings at each end had minor damage. Metal roofing was launched well up into trees at least 50 to 60 feet tall east of the farm buildings. Damage was estimated to be around 2 million dollars. Minor damage to a house and some trees was found at Stubblefield Road before the tornado ended.

Strong to severe convection over the Ozark Mountains moved east into an environment of very strong wind shear over southeast Missouri, with 850 mb winds near 60 knots. The convection maintained intensity after it crossed the Mississippi River during the early morning hours. Tremendous wind shear (winds of 50 knots down to 1500 feet above ground) and strong forcing associated with a potent 500 mb shortwave compensated for weak instability. Some of the strong winds aloft reached the surface in the form of gradient wind gusts from 40 to around 50 mph.

This storm proceeded east across Paducah and the Kentucky Lake region, where it produced a microburst and accumulating large hail. As the storm crossed the Pennyrile region, it produced an EF-1 tornado just south of Crofton, KY, in Christian County. Later on in the evening and overnight, disorganized clusters of thunderstorms produced a few isolated severe weather reports. This outbreak of storms occurred in a strong west-southwest flow ahead of a 500 mb shortwave over the Plains states. A southwest wind flow up to 30 knot at 850 mb provided some moisture for the storms. At the surface, a low pressure center moved east-northeast from the Ozarks to the lower Ohio Valley. A frontal boundary extending east-northeast from the low provided a focus for the storms.",

Several trees were either uprooted or pushed over, facing from the west-southwest to the east-northeast just west of Highway 231 on Fairview Road. The wind swath was about 200 yards wide. Just east of Highway 231 a large 40 x 60 storage barn for a camper had its roof partially lifted downwind to the east northeast. The metal siding was flung up to 150 yards into the trees. The tree damage continued along Alvaton- Scottsville Road into Marble Gate Ct. Several homes sustained roof damage, with several porches partially lifted up causing structural damage. One home on Marble Gate Court had four 20-pound steel chairs flung about 50 yards and the 35-pound table thrown 25 yards. Portions of the porch covering were blown 125 yards into the yard of their next-door neighbors yard, 2 of which punctured the house like a flying 2 by 4 missile. There were also portions of the deck impaled in the ground. The damage swatch then increased to about 225 yards and winds increased to 80 to 85 mph. There were at least three trees laying on homes.||Just east off Claypool Boyce Road... there was a distinct change in the tree pattern. Instead of just going to the northeast trees were now going to the northwest, north and northeast. A large 2 x 8 went flying and got wedged between the windshield wiper and the windshield but incredibly did not crack the windshield. This is where a small tornado formed within the straight-line wind path, with winds between 80 and 85 mph. Residents reported half inch hail, followed by a surge in lightning, then quiet, then a 20 second loud roar with popping in their ears followed by complete silence again. Further east in the 500 block of Kara Court, there was significant tree damage with the back of the house being uplifted and insulation being thrown upwind and downwind around the back of the house. Trees were laying in all directions with lots of twisting and many snapped trees. At the 200 block of Cross Creek Court, the clearest evidence of trees are facing all eight inter-cardinal headings. In this area, trees were snapped and uprooted all over the place. ||The survey team estimated well over 500 trees in a 1 mile stretch had been uprooted snapped or pushed over. Two of the snapped trees landed on pick up trucks. Winds increased to EF1 range of 95 mph and a width of 225 yards. At the 2400 block of WG Talley Road was the most significant damage of the entire survey. Three barns were destroyed, 2 of them were concreted in strong firm footers. One of the barns was 30 x 80, one was 150 x 100, and one was 12 x 16 along with numerous sheds destroyed, and debris was thrown in all directions downwind up to 500 yards. A 5000 pound horse trailer was thrown to the northwest 70 yards. ||A very well-built family residence took a direct hit from an EF2 tornado, with the front side of the home having the plywood exposed and with most of the shingles gone but the rest of the house fully intact due to the house having all the proper clips, braces, and rebar. Wind speeds at this point were 116 mph with a width of 250 yards. EF-1 Tree damage continued into Allen County along Allen Springs Road. The tornado lifted just north of Bailey School Road in far NW Allen County.",

As a result, a series of strong storms moved across south central Kentucky late on the evening of March 2nd and into the morning of March 3rd. Along with large hail, high winds, and some flash flooding, one particular storm produced a brief but strong tornado in southeast Warren County that crossed over into Allen County.",

At the 2400 block of WG Talley Road was the most significant damage of the entire survey. Three barns were destroyed, 2 of them were concreted in strong firm footers. One of the barns was 30 x 80, one was 150 x 100, and one was 12 x 16 along with numerous sheds destroyed, and debris was thrown in all directions downwind up to 500 yards. A 5000 pound horse trailer was thrown to the northwest 70 yards. ||A very well-built family residence took a direct hit from an EF2 tornado, with the front side of the home having the plywood exposed and with most of the shingles gone but the rest of the house fully intact due to the house having all the proper clips, braces, and rebar. Wind speeds at this point were 116 mph with a width of 250 yards. EF-1 Tree damage continued into Allen County along Allen Springs Road. The tornado lifted just north of Bailey School Road in far NW Allen County.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "During the day of March 2nd, southerly warm moist air moved through Kentucky from Tennessee just ahead of an upper trough and cold front. As a result, a series of strong storms moved across south central Kentucky late on the evening of March 2nd and into the morning of March 3rd. Along with large hail, high winds, and some flash flooding, one particular storm produced a brief but strong tornado in southeast Warren County that crossed over into Allen County.",

The upper part of the roof of a two story home was lifted off and thrown in various directions. Several large 2x10s and 2x8s were impaled in the ground about 50 yards from the barn. Two trees on the property sustained extensive twisting and several large section of the trees were snapped. The tornado at this point was only 35 yards wide with wind speeds of 95 mph. The owner of the house was upstairs sleeping, when he heard his ears popping, then a large roar of wind on top of the house and bricks fell on his bed. Surprisingly he sustained no injuries. The tornado then moved across a mixture of open farm fields and scattered forest. There is a significant swath of tree damage between Fairfield Road and Murrays Run Road, with trees uprooted, snapped, and twisted. Thanks to a nelson county drone you could clearly see trees laying in multiple directions. ||The tornado hit a property on Murrays Run Road ripping off the sides of a large well-built barn. The back part of the barn was thrown to the west while a wagon in the trailer was pushed out through the barn. A 72' x 12' shed next to the barn was destroyed. Parts of that barn were impaled into the ground 75 to 80 yards down wind. The tornado was at its widest at 45 yards here with 95 mph winds. Another remarkable thing is the family house was only 60 yards from the damage path, and did not lose even a shingle on the house. Across the street the tornado did extensive roof damage to a family house and barn, uplifting several large parts of it. Debris from the barn was thrown up to 300 yards downwind and in many different directions. The family said that they heard all the doors in the house shut tightly and heard a distinct roar. The tornado produced sporadic damage across farmland mainly in terms of trees, with more concentrated damage along Plum Run Road. Cedar tree damage was rather extensive with many cedars being snapped and twisted. Winds were around 90 mph here with a width of 40 yards. The tornado destroyed an old barn on Chester Hahn Road but weakened to an EF-0 of 80 mph and ended with a few snapped trees before Dugan Lane.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A strong storm system moved from the Midwest into the lower Ohio Valley on April 8, 2020. Isolated storms developed ahead of a sinking cold front during the afternoon across portions of southern Indiana and central Kentucky. These storms dropped large hail and produced damaging winds. Later that evening, a line of severe thunderstorms moved in from the northwest and produced widespread damaging winds and small hail. An EF-1 tornado spun up along the front edge of the line of severe storms and tracked for several miles across Nelson County. Storms pushed east of the region during the early morning hours of April 9, 2020.",

A brand new (1 month old) 64' x 56' barn was totally destroyed. The debris from the barn was thrown over a quarter of a mile down wind to the northeast. Another 60' x 43' barn that had recently been remodeled and upgraded had three walls blown out. A Kubota UTV weighing 2500 pounds was moved 30 yards and rotated 180 degrees. There was also extensive snapping and uprooting of trees. Winds were estimated to be 110 mph.||Farther to the northeast, a large 50' x 60' barn was destroyed, and debris went at least a half of a mile down wind. A mobile home along Hwy 829 was lifted off its foundation, and there were several trees uprooted and snapped.||The tornado crossed 829 and then crossed 1009 with extensive tree damage along both sides of the road. A large barn on 1009 had two walls blown out with debris thrown over a half of a mile downwind into Wayne county.||The tornado continued into far western portions of Wayne county.||Clinton County Emergency Management Director Lucas Abner and Dr. Bill Fountain, the Extension Specialist from the University of Kentucky Extension helped with the survey.",
            "EPISODE_NARRATIVE": "A stalled frontal boundary brought waves of heavy rainfall to central Kentucky from February 26 through February 28. This caused record rainfall, isolated severe winds, and even a tornado. As a result, Bowling Green set a February daily rainfall record with 5.11 on the 28th. The severe winds brought down some trees and a power pole, but the most property damage came from a brief EF1 tornado.",

Many roads were closed as cleanup continued. Emergency management reported 28 residential structures had some form of damage, and a dozen commercial structures were damaged as well. These included farming structures and equipment. One family was displaced from their mobile home because of damage from a fallen tree. A county state of emergency was declared. Peak winds were estimated near 105 mph.",
